* Upgrade Notes:
  zkspring.jar of 1.2.0 is now split into two separate jar file. zkspring-core.jar for Spring core and zkspring-security.jar for Spring Security.
  zkspring-security.jar depends on zkspring-core.jar. This also means corresponding .xsd files containing namespace definitions are also split.Please take a look at our online documentation for specific details.
  Due to changes in Spring Security 3.0.2 release Zk Spring Security defined custom filters now needs to be configured in Spring Security configuration file. Please take a look at our online documentation for specific details(http://docs.zkoss.org/wiki/Spring).
  Since it is upgraded to Spring 3.0 version it can only be used with Java 1.5 and higher version.
  Spring Webflow 2.0.3 and above is not compatible with Spring 3.0 yet hence ZK Spring Webflow support is not included in this 3.0RC release. For ZK Spring Webflow needs continue using ZK Spring 1.2.0 and earlier releases.
